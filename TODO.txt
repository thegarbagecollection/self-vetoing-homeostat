linking systems

different rendering modes - transition table or state-set (amoeba-like/rectangular)

system null-transition as base

editing mode (transitions for small systems; couplings maybe for larger but without the mapping possibility)
DSL specification of system group


system processing delays (see notes)

speed of perturbation

interactive with rendering?
