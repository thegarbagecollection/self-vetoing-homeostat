Interacting, coupled systems and environments - discrete states, single discrete time steps


Systems, transitions, nondeterministic transition
- states, transitions
- state can just be an identifier
- mark a system A in state i as A[i]
- deterministic transition: 
    where a system A is coupled to the systems (B1,...,Bn), we have, for all states i in A
    and all state tuples on *visible states* V1 x V2 x ... x Vn, we have a transition
        i , (v1,...,vn) -> i'
        
- nondeterministic transition
    where a system A is coupled to the systems (B1,...,Bn), we have, for all states i in A
    and all state tuples on *visible states* V1 x ... x Vn, we have a transition
        i , (v1,...,vn) -> (i'1:p1, ..., i'm:pm)
    where i'k:pk is the probability of state i'k being reached as a result of the transition, sum(p1,...,pm) = 1,
    m >= 1
- "death state" - a state where all transitions lead back to it
- Making a transition: deterministic
    on a timestep
        1) each system looks at all its incoming couplings, drawing from them the state tuple for the transition
        2) each system uses its state tuple (v1,...,vn) and current state i to look up the transition 
            i , (v1,...,vn) -> i'
           and sets itself to state i', informing all its outgoing couplings of the change
- Making a transition: nondeterministic
    on a timestep
        1) each system looks at all its incoming couplings, drawing from them the state tuple for the transition
        2) each system uses its state tuple (v1,...,vn) and current state i to look up the transition 
            i , (v1,...,vn) -> (i'1:p1, ..., i'm:pm)
           it chooses a random state i' from {i'1,...,i'm} using the appropriate probabilities
           it sets itself to state i', informing all its outgoing couplings of the change
      
      
Couplings, visible states (state mappings), and probabilistic couplings
- for systems A and B coupled by C=A->B, *visible states* of A in B are the outputs of C
- where A has states i1,...,im, we can map these to arbitrary elements of the set of visible states V={v1,...,vn} (k >= 1)
    for all i_j in A, exists some mapping i_j -> vk  where vk in V
    
- example: we have the identity mapping V=A={i1,...,im}
    i1->i1, ..., im->im
    
- example: Beer's homeostasis or not (h and n as outputs, V={h, n})
    i1->h, i2->n, i3->n,..., im->h
    
- let's add probabilistic couplings too: a probabilistic coupling is a coupling where 
    for all i_j in A, exists some probabilistic mapping i_j -> {v1:p1,...,vn:pn}
    
  with sum(p1,...,pn) = 1, and pk giving the probability that given an input of i_j, the
  coupling will produce output vk. a mapping i_j -> v_k is considered a special case where pk=1 and all other p=0
- these are kind of special cases of a coupling being a system in its own right
- CAN COUPLINGS CONDITION EACH OTHER? CAN COUPLINGS BE CONDITIONED OR ARE THEY FIXED?
    let's say no for now, they're fixed


Types of interacting system
- Environment
    not all aspects of it (states) impinge on every system - some leave the system unaffected
- Perturbing input
    changes its state through some internal logic, no incoming couplings
- Environment input
    changes its state through some internal logic, no incoming couplings
    not all aspects of it (states) impinge on every system - some leave the system unaffected
- Deterministic system
    all deterministic transitions
- Non-deterministic system
    at least one nondeterministic transition

TODO: we want a speed of perturbation for the perturbing / environmental inputs

    
    
Design:
---------------
Every system and coupling has a unique identifier (string? maybe caps for systems, lower case for couplings) 

a system A has:
- identifier
- a current state
- a list of all possible states
- a set of homeostasis states
- a set of "end" states
- a single transition table, as described above, containing
    rows: coupling visible state tuples in V1 x ... x Vn; columns: system states
    a link to each coupling
    a way to extract the current visible state tuple
    a "transition(oldState): State" message to use the retrieved state tuple and old state with the transition table to return the new state
- a list of outgoing couplings (no index needed, it's a blanket update)
- a prepareTransition() message to retrieve the current state tuple
- a transition() message to pass the current state into the transition table and set the current state to the returned result


A coupling c=A1->A2 has:
- identifier
- currently-set signal
- a map of states s in A1 to corresponding visible states v in V
    function? got to have access to the state of A1, its other data too
    (otherwise how does it know which states are homeostasis ones? maybe passed
     in on creation? what about the transition table? maybe later...)
- signal(state) operation to indicate that A1 has changed state
- retrieve() operation to apply the map s->v for the current state and give v to the transition table of A2

A transition table T for A has:
- an *ordered* list of couplings mapping to tuple positions
- a transition function A -> (V1, ..., Vn) -> A
- A TRANSITION `TABLE` MIGHT ONLY BE A STATE MAPPING WITH NO INPUT! s1 -> s2, s2 -> s3, s3 -> s2 etc.


How do we adapt this to allow each system A to "learn"?
- have to have extra data, and allow the transition table to be updated with each iteration based on previous state, current state etc
- have to allow learning "style" to switch based on current conditions
so: a learning "object" that has access to all the current data, is given the resulting state on transition(); also needs access to
the initial state of the object
learnFrom(newState)
startState(state)
must have access to the transition table so it can change it

UPDATE: LearningStrategy
- can only see when transition IS COMPLETED
- has access to the old state + the visible state tuple, their associated probability distribution, and the new state




System/coupling creation:
-------------------------
Take a system specification:
  a set of system ids B1, ..., Bn
    for each system id B, a set of state ids Bi for that system
    states don't need a unique name, they'll be namespaced

  coupling specifications: two systems A and B may have at most one coupling A->B
  ONE or BOTH of:
    1) a set of 4-tuples (A, B, identifier, mapping) for a coupling A->B with the given identifier
       where mapping is either "id" or a set of pairs (Ai, Vi) where Ai is a state of A and Vi a visible state OR NULL

    2) a map on ids B -> [A1, ..., An] where B, A1,...,An are system identifiers, and each of A1->B, ..., An->B is a coupling
       establishes order of the visible state tuple: (a1,...,an) where ai is a state of Ai

    if both 1 and 2, must be consistent
    if only 1, order of visible state tuple is taken from the order of the couplings
    if only 2, each coupling has an auto-generated id and the identity mapping

    a set of visible states

    every system mentioned in the coupling must be specified fully

  state transition specifications: for a system B 
    the set of state id tuples T = B x ((V1 x ... x Vn) u { null }) describing every possible transition input (Vi contains null as an element; all nulls maps to null-tuple?)
    a set of state transitions: 
      for all t in T, exists u in B s.t. the transition t->u exists
    the null transition; if no incoming couplings or an incoming coupling can be null ????
      for all u in B, exists v in B s.t. on no input we take transition u->v 


  mapping of identifier->display name for specified components (optional per component)

  environments?? LATER - select from a range of built-in behaviours or write code for them

syntactic features of the DSL:
  a state tuple with * in any position means it applies to all states of the coupling in that position



OPTIONAL system features
--------------------------
delay in processing a received signal: d_p; how long from the first time a signal is received until it is processed?
delay between signal receiving: d_r ; after a signal is received, how long until the next is received?
warm-up delay: d_w     (delay until first processing)
default 0 for all
then need a limited memory of some capacity, set to either discard newest or discard oldest
